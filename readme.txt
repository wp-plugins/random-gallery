Random Gallery lets you display a random selection of photos from an arbitrarily large list.

== Description ==

Random Gallery takes a list of photos (ids) and a number (shownum). It then picks that number of photos randomly from the list and uses the new list to make a normal gallery.

You can generate the list of ids by inserting a normal gallery shortcode, then copy/pasting the ids into the random-gallery shortcode, and finally deleting the normal gallery shortcode.

Example: [random-gallery ids="1,2,3,5,8" shownum="3"]

== Installation ==

Drop random-gallery.php in the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your wordPress installation and activate it from Plugins page.
